    "## Question 1: Propensity score matching\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply [propensity score matching](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf), which we discussed in lecture 5 (\"Observational studies\"), in order to draw conclusions from an observational study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a by-now classic dataset from Robert LaLonde's study \"[Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs](http://people.hbs.edu/nashraf/LaLonde_1986.pdf)\" (1986).\n",
    "The study investigated the effect of a job training program (\"National Supported Work Demonstration\") on the real earnings of an individual, a couple of years after completion of the program.\n",
    "Your task is to determine the effectiveness of the \"treatment\" represented by the job training program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "- `treat`: 1 if the subject participated in the job training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `age`: the subject's age\n",
    "- `educ`: years of education\n",
    "- `race`: categorical variable with three possible values: Black, Hispanic, or White\n",
    "- `married`: 1 if the subject was married at the time of the training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `nodegree`: 1 if the subject has earned no school degree, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `re74`: real earnings in 1974 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re75`: real earnings in 1975 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re78`: real earnings in 1978 (outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to brush up your knowledge on propensity scores and observational studies, we highly recommend Rosenbaum's excellent book on the [\"Design of Observational Studies\"](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf). Even just reading the first chapter (18 pages) will help you a lot."
