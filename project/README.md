# Title

# Abstract
We seek to use the data from the Federal Office of Statistics about votations to gain an insight of trends among swiss citizens. Our idea is to analyze a possible shift of opinions from a french/german split to a countryside/city split that has been reported in the media.

# Research questions
Voting trends will generally, like every trend, have outliers. Are there lots of "chronic losers" in swiss votations? Is this shift of trends to a city-countryside real? Are Italian speakers satisfied by decisions made at the federal level? Is there a linguistic split between German/French/Italian speakers?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

# Questions for TAa
We would like to use election data to get a better understanding of why people vote in a certain way on different issues, but could not find data for election results. Could you point us towards such data?
